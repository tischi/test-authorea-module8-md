3-D results visualization
=========================

At the end of the macro we can automatically load, show and even animate
the data in the 3-D viewer, using commands such as:

-   -   -   -   -   -   

The third item is used to add an image called “ImageName” to the viewer
and label it “RefToImageName” in the 3D viewer menu entry. In case you
did not have time to write up the complete macro during the practical a
possible solution is provided in: (code/**TubeAnalyst.ijm**). An example
overlay of the output files is shown in figure
 \[fig:bloodvesselsproj\].
