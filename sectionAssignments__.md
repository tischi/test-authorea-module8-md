Assignments
===========

3D viewer automation

:   \
    Add some more 3D viewer macro controls (in the last part of the
    complete macro). It is for instance possible to control the
    transparency of each object and many more features of the 3D viewer.
    You can experiment with it by recording these actions. Try to be
    creative!

Local statistics

:   \
    Write a macro to split the original stack in several sub-volumes of
    user defined size and estimate all the previous geometrical
    parameters in each of the sub-volumes. Doing so, one can access to
    the local values of these biological parameters. For this assignment
    you should rather use the larger stack (you might first need to
    slightly tune the parameters of your work-flow to get a valid
    segmentation). It is possible to run the whole pipeline on each
    sub-volume or, more efficiently, to run it once on the whole stack
    up to the segmentation and extract the information of interest in
    each sub-volume afterwards.
