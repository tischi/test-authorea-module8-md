Graphical user interface (GUI) {#sec:mod8lab1}
==============================

The pipeline of operations we came up with can now be assembled to a
complete macro to process the original stacks. Here, we add a dialog box
allowing the user to enter the macro parameters via a GUI. The GUI can
be created using the following macro commands:

-   -   -   -   

Add the dialog box to the beginning of your macro code and make sure
that the names of the parameters (variables) that you retrieve from the
GUI are the same as the parameters in your macro code. In addition you
have to remove (comment out) the explicit assignments of the input
parameters from your macro code (otherwise these explicit assignments
will overwrite the assignments from the GUI).
